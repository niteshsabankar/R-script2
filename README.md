This code is written for analysis of two oceanic species. E. Huxleyi and G. Oceanica RNA-Seq data was compared with each other and divided into different co-expressed group of genes between two species which are also called as ‘modules’. These modules are then compared with external traits to find out how the modules and traits are related. Functional enrichment analysis was also performed on these modules to identify significantly enriched genes in the interesting modules. After the analysis, by using 12 modules which are highly preserved in both the data sets, lipid metabolism genes and biomineralization genes to these modules are related and biological functions for these genes are obtained. Similarly, lists of genes which can be related to set of biomineralization genes was obtained which can vastly help us study biomineralization process in detail in the two species.
